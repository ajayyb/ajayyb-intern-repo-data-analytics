Understanding Clean Code Principles #40

Simplicitiy: Code should not be overly complex, function does what it should and not extra
Readability: Code is not condenesed or presented in such a way which makes it difficult to interpret/understand
Maintainability: The code is extensible and user-friendly (has comments for functions complex to understand)
Consistency: Conventional coding practices are followed (e.g. in an OOP system, polymorphism, abstraction, open/closed principle etc)
Efficiency: Code is optimised (runtime, time complexity?)
