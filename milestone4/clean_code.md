Understanding Clean Code Principles #40
 
 Simplicitiy: Code should not be overly complex, function does what it should and not extra
 Readability: Code is not condenesed or presented in such a way which makes it difficult to interpret/understand
 Maintainability: The code is extensible and user-friendly (has comments for functions complex to understand)
 Consistency: Conventional coding practices are followed (e.g. in an OOP system, polymorphism, abstraction, open/closed principle etc)
 Efficiency: Code is optimised (runtime, time complexity?)
 
 For code example: refer to messyCode.py file
