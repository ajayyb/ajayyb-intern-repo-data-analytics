When you get stuck - what next? #52

When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
- I prefer using google when looking for official documentation (such as API calls) or when i'm searching general information
- I prefer to use AI when I'm unsure with a specific problem, however I also use google to see if a similar problem to what I'm facing is there (primarily from stack overflow)
- I also prefer to use AI when I need a quick summarised answer from indepth information or specific explanations for complex concepts, as well as debugging suggestions

How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
- I would ask a college when I am stuck on a specific problem and need some new insight on how I could go about it
- Whena issue is specific to company specific code, where the collegue may have previous experience on why it is structured that way and its purpose

What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
- Lack of second perspective on the issue, where they could be missing simple mistakes
- Debugging can be quite complex at times and can be very time-consuming
